            <h2 class="subheading">Production Process Automation for a Pharmaceutical Brand. </h2>
            <p class="info">The healthcare sector across the world experienced a shockwave in terms of 
                hospitalization & production of necessary drugs/testing kits in 2019-20 as we were hit by 
                he Corona Virus pandemic. The need for covid testing increased exponentially everywhere. Along 
                with the RTPCR tests, which gave the results in a couple of days, the development of Rapid Antigen 
                (RAT) Covid testing kits started. It is a quick home test to check if you may have COVID-19 and provides 
                a result within 15 to 30 minutes with good accuracy. 
                <br> production had to match the required demand for the RAT kits. We designed &  manufactured affordable 
                semi-automatic liquid dispensing machines for a Pharmaceutical brand, which improved the production rate of one 
                of the components in the RAT kit 
                which ultimately increased their production with extra provided ease in the production process.

                <h3 class="subheading">Challenges</h3>
                <p class="info">The RAT kit consists of multiple components, one out of which is a
                    chemical solution that extracts the virus from samples. The solution in the kit 
                    is filled in a small container. The existing machines which are used to fill the 
                    tubes are batch filling machines which consume a good amount of time for the filling 
                    process, also they are priced at a very high cost. 
                    <br>
                    Roborise took the challenge of designing & developing a machine that gives a higher 
                    throughput and is able to dispense a specified amount of volume of the solution in a controlled manner.

            <div class="solution">
                <h3 class="subheading">Solution</h3>
                
                <p class="info" >     
                    After careful understanding of the required process & output, we developed 
                    a semi-automatic machine that generated a higher throughput of approximately 60 buffer 
                    tubes/min as seen with that of the existing machine which was approximately 45 buffer tubes/min. 

                    <br>The machine can dispense a constrained volume (as low as 0.1 ml) in any particular 
                    container. The flow parameters like the volume and the start/stop duration of the liquid flow 
                    can be varied according to the speed requirements in order to meet the scaling production needs. 
                    It was placed at a very affordable price point so that it becomes feasible to deploy many of such 
                    machines in order to boost the buffer tubes' production capacity.  Hence, the machine not only catered 
                    to an increased production but also was very cost-efficient.
